Two-Stream predict = predict.py
Two-Stream attack = attack.py

If you want to run program, see below.

Requirement :
    - Keras on Python3
    - Tensorflow / Theano on Python3
    - Opencv2 on Python3
    - foolbox on Python3
    - Data UCF - 101

Dataset path configure:
    
    - Open paths.py
    - Change variables of path
    
    About variables:
    
        test_x_path is text file path, That involving choosen names of video names on UCF-101.
        test_y_path is text file path, That involving choosen categories on UCF-101.
        
        temporal_path_hor = DataSet Temporal horizontal path
        temporal_path_ver = DataSet Temporal vertical path
        
        spatial_path = Dataset Spatial path
        
        temporal_model_path = Two-Stream Temporal model file path
        spatial_model_path = Two-Stream Spatial model file path
            
    
Compile program:
    - Run Two-Stream predicts : 
        
            python3 -W ignore predict.py
    
    - Run Attack to video frames And Two-Stream predicts : 
        
            python3 -W ignore predict.py
    
    - Try access
